With this assignment you you will be able to generate a team profile. It will be able to run in the command line by using node. The generater will prompt questions for each role ( manager, intern, and engineer). The selections will gather each employees name, id and emaail. Depending on the role it will either ask for school name for the intern, office number for the manager and github for the engineer. Once all of that information is gathered you then will be able to have the option to finish the selection and the generater will generate a profile for each user that will be able to be displayed on your web browser.
